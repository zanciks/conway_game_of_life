A very crude implimentation of Conway's game of life. I coded this in around 2 hours.
I used (for the first time) multiple viewports in egui/eframe. I'm not sure how this will look on Windows yet, but it works well on linux.
To run the program, simply download the repo and do `cargo run --release`!
